# Trends in Advanced Math Performance by State

This report displays trends in the percentage of students at the **Advanced** level in **Grade 4 and Grade 8 Mathematics**.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
here()
# Load state name mapping
states <- read_excel("../../data/states.xlsx")  # Ensure this file contains "State" and "Abbreviation"

# Define output directory
output_dir <- "output_plots/"
image_files <- list.files(output_dir, pattern = "*.png", full.names = FALSE)  # Use relative paths

# Order the images alphabetically by filename
image_files <- sort(image_files)
```

## **State-by-State Trends**

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# Loop through each image file and include it in the Quarto document
for (file in image_files) {
  # Extract state abbreviation from filename (e.g., "trend_AK.png" -> "AK")
  state_abbr <- gsub("trend_|\\.png", "", basename(file))
  
  # Find the corresponding full state name
  state_full <- states$State[match(state_abbr, states$Abbreviation)]
  
  # Use the full state name before the image
  cat("###", state_full, "\n\n")  # Create a section header for each state
  cat("![](output_plots/", file, ")\n\n", sep = "")  # Ensure correct path
}
```
